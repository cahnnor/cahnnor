# A bit about me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cahnnor. I'm a software engineer at Clio, and I sometimes use this account for personal projects.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cloud Infrastructure, Web Development, and Game Development!
- ðŸŒ± I've taken a break from personal projects for a while, but I'm hoping to work on some stuff here again soon!
